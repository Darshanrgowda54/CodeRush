## DataTypes

1. Datatypes specifies the type of data that the variable can hold.
2. Datatype will indicate the compiler how much of memory has to be allocated for the variable associated with it.

## Different data types

### Primitive data types

- int datatype = 4 bytes
- float datatype = 4 bytes
- char datatype = 1 bytes
- double datatype =8 bytes

### Derived data types

- Arrays
- Functions
- Pointers

### User Defined Datatypes

- Structure
- enum

### Key points 
- sizeof(12.3) will be considered as double by default and gives size as 8 bytes 
- sizeof(12.5f) will be considered as float by default and gives size as 4 bytes 
- sizeof(void *) pointer is 8 bytes 
- sizeof(void) datatype is 1 byte 
- sizeof(int *) pointer is 8 bytes 
- sizeof(float *) pointer is 8 bytes 
- sizeof(char *) pointer is 8 bytes 
- sizeof(double *) pointer is 8 bytes
